# GlassKit

## Description
GlassKit is a personal project for experimenting with graphics programming. It’s a space where I explore shapes, shaders, and textures while learning and improving.

I’m currently finishing my second year of computer science studies, and there’s still plenty of room for improvement in this project. I welcome any feedback and advice and will take it very seriously to keep improving.
