# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project secure.

If you discover a security vulnerability or have a security concern, **please do not disclose it publicly**.  
Instead, reach out directly to me via email at:  
**info@lunary.ca**

I take security seriously and will investigate any issues as quickly as possible. Here's how I handle vulnerabilities:

1. **Acknowledgment**: I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation**: I will review the issue, assess its severity, and begin working on a solution.
3. **Resolution**: I will release a fix as soon as possible and notify you once it's resolved.

## Supported Versions

I mainly focus on the latest version of the project. Please use the most recent release to benefit from security updates and fixes.

## Security Updates

Critical security vulnerabilities will be patched as soon as they are identified. For less critical issues, I will release fixes in the next project update.

## Reporting Guidelines

- Please include as much detail as possible, including how to reproduce the issue if applicable.
- Avoid sharing sensitive information (e.g., passwords) in your report.
- If possible, provide context about your environment (OS, libraries, etc.).

## Best Practices

- Always keep your dependencies updated.
- Use secure coding practices and avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
- If applicable, use encryption and strong authentication mechanisms for sensitive data.

## Thank You

Your effort to make this project more secure is truly appreciated. Together, we can help ensure that this project remains safe for everyone using it.
